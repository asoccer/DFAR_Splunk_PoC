    <h2>Supplemental Guidance</h2>
    <p>
      The organization assesses the security controls in an information system as
      part of: (i) security authorization or reauthorization; (ii) meeting the FISMA requirement for
      annual assessments; (iii) continuous monitoring; and (iv) testing/evaluation of the information
      system as part of the system development life cycle process. The assessment report documents the
      assessment results in sufficient detail as deemed necessary by the organization, to determine the
      accuracy and completeness of the report and whether the security controls are implemented
      correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the
      security requirements of the information system. The FISMA requirement for (at least) annual
      security control assessments should not be interpreted by organizations as adding additional
      assessment requirements to those requirements already in place in the security authorization
      process. To satisfy the FISMA annual assessment requirement, organizations can draw upon the
      security control assessment results from any of the following sources, including but not limited to:
      (i) assessments conducted as part of an information system authorization or reauthorization
      process; (ii) continuous monitoring (see CA-7); or (iii) testing and evaluation of an information
      system as part of the ongoing system development life cycle (provided that the testing and
      evaluation results are current and relevant to the determination of security control effectiveness).
      Existing security control assessment results are reused to the extent that they are still valid and are
      supplemented with additional assessments as needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Subsequent to the initial authorization of the information system and in accordance with OMB
      policy, the organization assesses a subset of the security controls annually during continuous
      monitoring. The organization establishes the security control selection criteria and subsequently
      selects a subset of the security controls within the information system and its environment of
      operation for assessment. Those security controls that are the most volatile (i.e., controls most
      affected by ongoing changes to the information system or its environment of operation) or deemed
      critical by the organization to protecting organizational operations and assets, individuals, other
      organizations, and the Nation are assessed more frequently in accordance with an organizational
      assessment of risk. All other controls are assessed at least once during the information system's
      three-year authorization cycle. The organization can use the current years assessment results
      from any of the above sources to meet the FISMA annual assessment requirement provided that
      the results are current, valid, and relevant to determining security control effectiveness. External
      audits (e.g., audits conducted by external entities such as regulatory agencies) are outside the
      scope of this control. Related controls: CA-6, CA-7, PM-9, SA-11.

    <h2>Control Enhancements</h2>
    <ol class="decimal">
      <li>The organization employs an independent assessor or assessment team to conduct an
          assessment of the security controls in the information system.
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u> An independent assessor or assessment team is any
          individual or group capable of conducting an impartial assessment of an organizational
          information system. Impartiality implies that the assessors are free from any perceived or
          actual conflicts of interest with respect to the developmental, operational, and/or management
          chain associated with the information system or to the determination of security control
          effectiveness. Independent security assessment services can be obtained from other elements
          within the organization or can be contracted to a public or private sector entity outside of the
          organization. Contracted assessment services are considered independent if the information
          system owner is not directly involved in the contracting process or cannot unduly influence
          the impartiality of the assessor or assessment team conducting the assessment of the security
          controls in the information system. The authorizing official determines the required level of
          assessor independence based on the security categorization of the information system and/or
          the ultimate risk to organizational operations and assets, and to individuals. The authorizing
          official determines if the level of assessor independence is sufficient to provide confidence
          that the assessment results produced are sound and can be used to make a credible, risk-based
          decision. In special situations, for example when the organization that owns the information
          system is small or the organizational structure requires that the assessment be accomplished
          by individuals that are in the developmental, operational, and/or management chain of the
          system owner, independence in the assessment process can be achieved by ensuring that the
          assessment results are carefully reviewed and analyzed by an independent team of experts to
          validate the completeness, accuracy, integrity, and reliability of the results.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>The organization includes as part of security control assessments, [Assignment: organization-
          defined frequency], [Selection: announced; unannounced], [Selection: in-depth monitoring;
          malicious user testing; penetration testing; red team exercises; [Assignment: organization-defined
          other forms of security testing]].
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u> Penetration testing exercises both physical and technical
          security controls. A standard method for penetration testing consists of: (i) pretest analysis
          based on full knowledge of the target system; (ii) pretest identification of potential
          vulnerabilities based on pretest analysis; and (iii) testing designed to determine exploitability
          of identified vulnerabilities. Detailed rules of engagement are agreed upon by all parties
          before the commencement of any penetration testing scenario. These rules of engagement are
          correlated with the tools, techniques, and procedures that are anticipated to be employed by
          threat-sources in carrying out attacks. An organizational assessment of risk guides the
          decision on the level of independence required for penetration agents or penetration teams
          conducting penetration testing. Red team exercises are conducted as a simulated adversarial
          attempt to compromise organizational missions and/or business processes to provide a
          comprehensive assessment of the security capability of the information system and
          organization. While penetration testing may be laboratory-based testing, red team exercises
          are intended to be more comprehensive in nature and reflect real-world conditions.
          Information system monitoring, malicious user testing, penetration testing, red-team
          exercises, and other forms of security testing (e.g., independent verification and validation)
          are conducted to improve the readiness of the organization by exercising organizational
          capabilities and indicating current performance levels as a means of focusing organizational
          actions to improve the security state of the system and organization. Testing is conducted in
          accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations,
          and standards. Testing methods are approved by authorizing officials in coordination with the
          organization's Risk Executive Function. Vulnerabilities uncovered during red team exercises
          are incorporated into the vulnerability remediation process. Related controls: RA-5, SI-2.
