      The organization:
      <ol class="loweralpha">
        <li>Establishes and documents mandatory configuration settings for information technology
            products employed within the information system using [Assignment: organization-defined
            security configuration checklists] that reflect the most restrictive mode consistent with
            operational requirements;</li>
        <li>Implements the configuration settings;</li>
        <li>Identifies, documents, and approves exceptions from the mandatory configuration settings for
            individual components within the information system based on explicit operational
            requirements; and</li>
        <li>Monitors and controls changes to the configuration settings in accordance with organizational
            policies and procedures.</li>

    <h2>Supplemental Guidance</h2>
    <p>
      Configuration settings are the configurable security-related parameters of
      information technology products that are part of the information system. Security-related
      parameters are those parameters impacting the security state of the system including parameters
      related to meeting other security control requirements. Security-related parameters include, for
      example, registry settings; account, file, and directory settings (i.e., permissions); and settings for
      services, ports, protocols, and remote connections. Organizations establish organization-wide
      mandatory configuration settings from which the settings for a given information system are
      derived. A security configuration checklist (sometimes referred to as a lockdown guide, hardening
      guide, security guide, security technical implementation guide [STIG], or benchmark) is a series of
      instructions or procedures for configuring an information system component to meet operational
      requirements. Checklists can be developed by information technology developers and vendors,
      consortia, academia, industry, federal agencies (and other government organizations), and others
      in the public and private sectors. An example of a security configuration checklist is the Federal
      Desktop Core Configuration (FDCC) which potentially affects the implementation of CM-6 and
      other controls such as AC-19 and CM-7. The Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) and
      defined standards within the protocol (e.g., Common Configuration Enumeration) provide an
      effective method to uniquely identify, track, and control configuration settings. OMB establishes
      federal policy on configuration requirements for federal information systems. Related controls:
      CM-2, CM-3, SI-4.

    <h2>Control Enhancements</h2>
    <ol class="decimal">
      <li>The organization employs automated mechanisms to centrally manage, apply, and verify
          configuration settings.</li>
      <li>The organization employs automated mechanisms to respond to unauthorized changes to
          [Assignment: organization-defined configuration settings].
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u> Responses to unauthorized changes to configuration
          settings can include, for example, alerting designated organizational personnel, restoring
          mandatory/organization-defined configuration settings, or in the extreme case, halting
          affected information system processing.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>The organization incorporates detection of unauthorized, security-relevant configuration changes
          into the organizationâ€™s incident response capability to ensure that such detected events are
          tracked, monitored, corrected, and available for historical purposes.
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u> Related controls: IR-4, IR-5.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>The information system (including modifications to the baseline configuration) demonstrates
          conformance to security configuration guidance (i.e., security checklists), prior to being introduced
          into a production environment.</li>
