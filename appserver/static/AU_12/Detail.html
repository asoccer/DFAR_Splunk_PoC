    <h2>Control</h2>
    <p>The information system:
      <ol class="loweralpha">
        <li>Provides audit record generation capability for the list of auditable events defined in AU-2 at
            [Assignment: organization-defined information system components];</li>
        <li>Allows designated organizational personnel to select which auditable events are to be audited
            by specific components of the system; and</li>
        <li>Generates audit records for the list of audited events defined in AU-2 with the content as
            defined in AU-3.</li>
      </ol>

    <h2>Supplemental Guidance</h2>
    <p>
      Audits records can be generated from various components within the
      information system. The list of audited events is the set of events for which audits are to be
      generated. This set of events is typically a subset of the list of all events for which the system is
      capable of generating audit records (i.e., auditable events). Related controls: AU-2, AU-3.

  <div>
    <h2>Control Enhancements</h2>
    <ol class="decimal">
      <li>The information system compiles audit records from [Assignment: organization-defined
          information system components] into a system-wide (logical or physical) audit trail that is time-
          correlated to within [Assignment: organization-defined level of tolerance for relationship between
          time stamps of individual records in the audit trail].
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance</u> The audit trail is time-correlated if the time stamp in the
          individual audit records can be reliably related to the time stamp in other audit records to
          achieve a time ordering of the records within the organization-defined tolerance.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>The information system produces a system-wide (logical or physical) audit trail composed of audit
          records in a standardized format.
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance</u> Audit information normalized to a common standard
          promotes interoperability and exchange of such information between dissimilar devices and
          information systems. This facilitates an audit system that produces event information that can
          be more readily analyzed and correlated. System log records and audit records compliant
          with the Common Event Expression (CEE) are examples of standard formats for audit
          records. If individual logging mechanisms within the information system do not conform to a
          standardized format, the system may convert individual audit records into a standardized
          format when compiling the system-wide audit trail.
