    <h1>AC-6 LEAST PRIVILEGE</h1><br/>

    <h2>Control</h2>
    <p>
      The organization employs the concept of least privilege, allowing only authorized
      accesses for users (and processes acting on behalf of users) which are necessary to accomplish
      assigned tasks in accordance with organizational missions and business functions.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Supplemental Guidance</h2>
    <p>
      The access authorizations defined in this control are largely implemented
      by control AC-3. The organization employs the concept of least privilege for specific duties and
      information systems (including specific ports, protocols, and services) in accordance with risk
      assessments as necessary to adequately mitigate risk to organizational operations and assets,
      individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. Related controls: AC-2, AC-3, CM-7.

    <h2>Control Enhancements</h2>
    <ol class="decimal">
      <li>The organization explicitly authorizes access to [Assignment: organization-defined list of
          security functions (deployed in hardware, software, and firmware) and security-relevant information].
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u> Establishing system accounts, configuring access
          authorizations (i.e., permissions, privileges), setting events to be audited, and setting intrusion
          detection parameters are examples of security functions. Explicitly authorized personnel include,
          for example, security administrators, system and network administrators, system security officers,
          system maintenance personnel, system programmers, and other privileged users. Related control: AC-17.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>The organization requires that users of information system accounts, or roles, with access to
          [Assignment: organization-defined list of security functions or security-relevant information], use
          non-privileged accounts, or roles, when accessing other system functions, and if feasible, audits any
          use of privileged accounts, or roles, for such functions.
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u> This control enhancement is intended to limit exposure due to
          operating from within a privileged account or role. The inclusion of role is intended to address those
          situations where an access control policy such as Role Based Access Control (RBAC) is being implemented
          and where a change of role provides the same degree of assurance in the change of access authorizations
          for both the user and all processes acting on behalf of the user as would be provided by a change between
          a privileged and non-privileged account. Audit of privileged activity may require physical separation
          employing information systems on which the user does not have privileged access.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>The organization authorizes network access to [Assignment: organization-defined privileged commands] only
          for compelling operational needs and documents the rationale for such access in the security plan for the
          information system.</li>
      <li>The information system provides separate processing domains to enable finer-grained allocation of user privileges.
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u> Employing virtualization techniques to allow greater privilege within a
          virtual machine while restricting privilege to the underlying actual machine is an example of providing
          separate processing domains for finer-grained allocation of user privileges.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>The organization limits authorization to super user accounts on the information system to designated system
          administration personnel.
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u> Super user accounts are typically described as “root” or
          “administrator” for various types of commercial off-the-shelf operating systems. Configuring
          organizational information systems (e.g., notebook/laptop computers, servers, workstations)
          such that day-to-day users are not authorized access to super user accounts is an example of
          limiting system authorization. The organization may differentiate in the application of this
          control enhancement between allowed privileges for local information system accounts and
          for domain accounts provided the organization retains the ability to control the configuration
          of the system with regard to key security parameters and as otherwise necessary to
          sufficiently mitigate risk.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>The organization prohibits privileged access to the information system by non-organizational users.</li>
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u> A qualified organizational user may be advised by a
          non-organizational user, if necessary.
