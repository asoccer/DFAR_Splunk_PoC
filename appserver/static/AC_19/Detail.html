      <ol class="loweralpha">
        <li>Establishes usage restrictions and implementation guidance for organization-controlled

    <h2>Supplemental Guidance</h2>
    <p>
      Mobile devices include portable storage media (e.g., USB memory sticks,
      external hard disk drives) and portable computing and communications devices with information
      storage capability (e.g., notebook/laptop computers, personal digital assistants, cellular telephones,
      digital cameras, and audio recording devices). Organization-controlled mobile devices include
      those devices for which the organization has the authority to specify and the ability to enforce
      specific security requirements. Usage restrictions and implementation guidance related to mobile
      devices include, for example, configuration management, device identification and authentication,
      implementation of mandatory protective software (e.g., malicious code detection, firewall),
      scanning devices for malicious code, updating virus protection software, scanning for critical
      software updates and patches, conducting primary operating system (and possibly other resident
      software) integrity checks, and disabling unnecessary hardware (e.g., wireless, infrared).
      Examples of information system functionality that provide the capability for automatic execution
      of code are AutoRun and AutoPlay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Organizational policies and procedures for mobile devices used by individuals departing on and
      returning from travel include, for example, determining which locations are of concern, defining
      required configurations for the devices, ensuring that the devices are configured as intended before
      travel is initiated, and applying specific measures to the device after travel is completed. Specially
      configured mobile devices include, for example, computers with sanitized hard drives, limited
      applications, and additional hardening (e.g., more stringent configuration settings). Specified
      measures applied to mobile devices upon return from travel include, for example, examining the
      device for signs of physical tampering and purging/reimaging the hard disk drive. Protecting
      information residing on mobile devices is covered in the media protection family. Related
      controls: MP-4, MP-5.

    <h2>Control Enhancements</h2>
    <ol class="decimal">
      <li>The organization restricts the use of writable, removable media in organizational information
          systems.</li>
      <li>The organization prohibits the use of personally owned, removable media in organizational
          information systems.</li>
      <li>The organization prohibits the use of removable media in organizational information systems when
          the media has no identifiable owner.
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u> An identifiable owner (e.g., individual, organization, or
          project) for removable media helps to reduce the risk of using such technology by assigning
          responsibility and accountability for addressing known vulnerabilities in the media (e.g.,
          malicious code insertion).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>The organization:
        <ol class="loweralpha">
          <li>Prohibits the use of unclassified mobile devices in facilities containing information systems
              processing, storing, or transmitting classified information unless specifically permitted by the
              appropriate authorizing official(s); and</li>
          <li>Enforces the following restrictions on individuals permitted to use mobile devices in facilities
              containing information systems processing, storing, or transmitting classified information:
            <ul>
              <li>Connection of unclassified mobile devices to classified information systems is
                  prohibited;</li>
              <li>Connection of unclassified mobile devices to unclassified information systems requires
                  approval from the appropriate authorizing official(s);</li>
              <li>Use of internal or external modems or wireless interfaces within the mobile devices is
                  prohibited; and</li>
              <li>Mobile devices and the information stored on those devices are subject to random
                  reviews/inspections by [Assignment: organization-defined security officials], and if
                  classified information is found, the incident handling policy is followed.</li>
