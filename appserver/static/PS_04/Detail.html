        <li>Terminates information system access;</li>
        <li>Conducts exit interviews;</li>
        <li>Retrieves all security-related organizational information system-related property; and</li>
        <li>Retains access to organizational information and information systems formerly controlled by

    <h2>Supplemental Guidance</h2>
    <p>
      Information system-related property includes, for example, hardware
      authentication tokens, system administration technical manuals, keys, identification cards, and
      building passes. Exit interviews ensure that individuals understand any security constraints
      imposed by being former employees and that proper accountability is achieved for all information
      system-related property. Exit interviews may not be possible for some employees (e.g., in the case
      of job abandonment, some illnesses, and nonavailability of supervisors). Exit interviews are
      important for individuals with security clearances. Timely execution of this control is particularly
      essential for employees or contractors terminated for cause.
