    <h2>Supplemental Guidance</h2>
    <p>
      Wireless technologies include, but are not limited to, microwave, satellite,
      packet radio (UHF/VHF), 802.11x, and Bluetooth. Wireless networks use authentication
      protocols (e.g., EAP/TLS, PEAP), which provide credential protection and mutual authentication.
      In certain situations, wireless signals may radiate beyond the confines and control of organization-
      controlled facilities. Related controls: AC-3, IA-2, IA-3, IA-8.

    <h2>Control Enhancements</h2>
    <ol class="decimal">
      <li>The information system protects wireless access to the system using authentication and
          encryption.
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u> Authentication applies to user, device, or both as
          necessary. Related control: SC-13.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>The organization monitors for unauthorized wireless connections to the information system,
          including scanning for unauthorized wireless access points [Assignment: organization-defined
          frequency], and takes appropriate action if an unauthorized connection is discovered.
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u> Organizations proactively search for unauthorized
          wireless connections including the conduct of thorough scans for unauthorized wireless access
          points. The scan is not necessarily limited to only those areas within the facility containing
          the information systems, yet is conducted outside of those areas only as needed to verify that
          unauthorized wireless access points are not connected to the system.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>The organization disables, when not intended for use, wireless networking capabilities internally
          embedded within information system components prior to issuance and deployment.</li>
      <li>The organization does not allow users to independently configure wireless networking capabilities.</li>
      <li>The organization confines wireless communications to organization-controlled boundaries.
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u> Actions that may be taken by the organization to confine
          wireless communications to organization-controlled boundaries include: (i) reducing the
          power of the wireless transmission such that it cannot transit the physical perimeter of the
          organization; (ii) employing measures such as TEMPEST to control wireless emanations; and
          (iii) configuring the wireless access such that it is point to point in nature.
