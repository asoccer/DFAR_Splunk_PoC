    <h2>Control Enhancements</h2>
    <ol class="digit">
      <li>The organization employs automated mechanisms to increase the availability of incident response-
          related information and support.
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u>
          Automated mechanisms can provide a push and/or pull
          capability for users to obtain incident response assistance. For example, individuals might
          have access to a website to query the assistance capability, or conversely, the assistance
          capability may have the ability to proactively send information to users (general distribution
          or targeted) as part of increasing understanding of current response capabilities and support.

      <li>The organization:
        <ol class="loweralpha">
          <li>Establishes a direct, cooperative relationship between its incident response capability and
              external providers of information system protection capability; and</li>
          <li>Identifies organizational incident response team members to the external providers.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u>
          External providers of information system protection
          capability include, for example, the Computer Network Defense program within the U.S.
          Department of Defense. External providers help to protect, monitor, analyze, detect, and
          respond to unauthorized activity within organizational information systems and networks.
