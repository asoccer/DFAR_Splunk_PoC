    <h2>Supplemental Guidance</h2>
    <p>
      Documenting information system security incidents includes, for example,
      maintaining records about each incident, the status of the incident, and other pertinent information
      necessary for forensics, evaluating incident details, trends, and handling. Incident information can
      be obtained from a variety of sources including, for example, incident reports, incident response
      teams, audit monitoring, network monitoring, physical access monitoring, and user/administrator
      reports.
