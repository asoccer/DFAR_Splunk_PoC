      The organization configures the information system to provide only essential capabilities

    <h2>Supplemental Guidance</h2>
    <p>
      Information systems are capable of providing a wide variety of functions
      and services. Some of the functions and services, provided by default, may not be necessary to
      support essential organizational operations (e.g., key missions, functions). Additionally, it is
      sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from a single component of an information
      system, but doing so increases risk over limiting the services provided by any one component.
      Where feasible, organizations limit component functionality to a single function per device (e.g.,
      email server or web server, not both). The functions and services provided by organizational
      information systems, or individual components of information systems, are carefully reviewed to
      determine which functions and services are candidates for elimination (e.g., Voice Over Internet
      Protocol, Instant Messaging, auto-execute, file sharing). Organizations consider disabling unused
      or unnecessary physical and logical ports and protocols (e.g., Universal Serial Bus [USB], File
      Transfer Protocol [FTP], Internet Protocol Version 6 [IPv6], Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
      [HTTP]) on information system components to prevent unauthorized connection of devices,
      unauthorized transfer of information, or unauthorized tunneling. Organizations can utilize
      network scanning tools, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and end-point protections
      such as firewalls and host-based intrusion detection systems to identify and prevent the use of
      prohibited functions, ports, protocols, and services. Related control: RA-5.
