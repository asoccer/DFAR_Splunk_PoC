      This application was created as a framework. Each search utilizes eventtypes and tagging in order
      to more easily customize the integration of other data sources.  This help section outlines the
      definition of the searches, and supplies a listing of the fields which may be used
      for reporting.  Please take a look at the
        <a href="${make_url(['app',APP['id'],'about'])}" target=_blank>About</a>
      page for more information on customization.
    </p>

    <p>
      This control utilizes data from the
      <b>
        <a href="${make_url(['manager',APP['id'],'admin','macros','logins(1)'], _qs=dict(action='edit'))}" target=_blank>`logins`</a>
      </b>
      search macro.  Additionally, <b>lookups/account_mapping.csv</b> is utilized as a source for account_type and organization fields, based on the user.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Account Login Monitoring</h3>
    <p>
      The
      <b>
        <a href="${make_url(['manager',APP['id'],'admin','macros','logins(1)'], _qs=dict(action='edit'))}" target=_blank>`logins`</a>
      </b> macro is defined as:<br/><br/>

      <code>
        tag=authentication user=* $filter$ `login_filter`<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;
        | lookup account_mapping user<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;
        | fillnull value=unknown user, app, src, src_ip, dest, action, account_type, organization
      </code>
    </p>

    <p>
      In the event that there are filter-based modifications to the search that you'd
      like to employ permanently, you may edit the
      <b>
        <a href="${make_url(['manager',APP['id'],'admin','macros','logins_filter'], _qs=dict(action='edit'))}" target=_blank>`logins_filter`</a>
      </b> to
      affect the results.  Further adjustments may require  modifying the
      <b>
        <a href="${make_url(['manager',APP['id'],'admin','macros','logins(1)'], _qs=dict(action='edit'))}" target=_blank>`logins`</a>
      </b> macro itself.
    </p>

    <p>
      Recommended Fields:
      <ul>
        <li>user = the user logging in</li>
        <li>app = the login app (i.e. su, win:remote, etc)</li>
        <li>src = source host of the login</li>
        <li>src_ip = source IP address of the login</li>
        <li>dest = destination host of the login</li>
        <li>action = this should state the success status (success or failure) of the event</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Lookups</h3>
    <p>
      Some of the information in this report is provided by a lookup in order to add account_type and organization fields.
      The account_type should be one of: system, guest, temporary, application, group, or individual.  By default, the 
      account_type for a user will be set to "individual", if nothing is specified.  The organization field should be
      populated with the user's parent organization at the desired granularity.
