    <h1>AU-2 AUDITABLE EVENTS</h1><br/>

    <h2>Control</h2>
    <p>
      The organization:<br/>
      <ol class="loweralpha">
        <li>Determines, based on a risk assessment and mission/business needs, that the information
            system must be capable of auditing the following events: [Assignment: organization-defined
            list of auditable events];</li>
        <li>Coordinates the security audit function with other organizational entities requiring audit-
            related information to enhance mutual support and to help guide the selection of auditable
            events;</li>
        <li>Provides a rationale for why the list of auditable events are deemed to be adequate to support
            after-the-fact investigations of security incidents; and</li>
        <li>Determines, based on current threat information and ongoing assessment of risk, that the
            following events are to be audited within the information system: [Assignment: organization-
            defined subset of the auditable events defined in AU-2 a. to be audited along with the
            frequency of (or situation requiring) auditing for each identified event].</li>
      </ol>

    <h2>Supplemental Guidance</h2>
    <p>
      The purpose of this control is for the organization to identify events which
      need to be auditable as significant and relevant to the security of the information system; giving an
      overall system requirement in order to meet ongoing and specific audit needs. To balance auditing
      requirements with other information system needs, this control also requires identifying that subset
      of auditable events that are to be audited at a given point in time. For example, the organization
      may determine that the information system must have the capability to log every file access both
      successful and unsuccessful, but not activate that capability except for specific circumstances due
      to the extreme burden on system performance. In addition, audit records can be generated at
      various levels of abstraction, including at the packet level as information traverses the network.
      Selecting the right level of abstraction for audit record generation is a critical aspect of an audit
      capability and can facilitate the identification of root causes to problems. Related control: AU-3.
