    <h1>CM-2 BASELINE CONFIGURATION</h1><br/>

    <h2>Control</h2>
    <p>
      The organization develops, documents, and maintains under configuration control, a
      current baseline configuration of the information system.
    </p>

    <h2>Supplemental Guidance</h2>
    <p>
      This control establishes a baseline configuration for the information system
      and its constituent components including communications and connectivity-related aspects of the
      system. The baseline configuration provides information about the components of an information
      system (e.g., the standard software load for a workstation, server, network component, or mobile
      device including operating system/installed applications with current version numbers and patch
      information), network topology, and the logical placement of the component within the system
      architecture. The baseline configuration is a documented, up-to-date specification to which the
      information system is built. Maintaining the baseline configuration involves creating new
      baselines as the information system changes over time. The baseline configuration of the
      information system is consistent with the organization's enterprise architecture. Related controls:
      CM-3, CM-6, CM-8, CM-9.

    <h2>Control Enhancements</h2>
    <ol class="decimal">
      <li>The organization reviews and updates the baseline configuration of the information system:
        <ol class="loweralpha">
          <li>[Assignment: organization-defined frequency];</li>
          <li>When required due to [Assignment organization-defined circumstances]; and</li>
          <li>As an integral part of information system component installations and upgrades.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>The organization employs automated mechanisms to maintain an up-to-date, complete, accurate,
          and readily available baseline configuration of the information system.
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u> Software inventory tools are examples of automated
          mechanisms that help organizations maintain consistent baseline configurations for
          information systems. Software inventory tools can be deployed for each operating system in
          use within the organization (e.g., on workstations, servers, network components, mobile
          devices) and used to track operating system version numbers, applications and types of
          software installed on the operating systems, and current patch levels. Software inventory
          tools can also scan information systems for unauthorized software to validate organization-
          defined lists of authorized and unauthorized software programs.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>The organization retains older versions of baseline configurations as deemed necessary to support rollback.</li>
      <li>The organization:
        <ol class="loweralpha">
          <li>Develops and maintains [Assignment: organization-defined list of software programs not
              authorized to execute on the information system]; and</li>
          <li>Employs an allow-all, deny-by-exception authorization policy to identify software allowed to
              execute on the information system.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>The organization:
        <ol class="loweralpha">
          <li>Develops and maintains [Assignment: organization-defined list of software programs 
              authorized to execute on the information system]; and</li>
          <li>Employs a deny-all, permit-by-exception authorization policy to identify software allowed to
              execute on the information system.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>The organization maintains a baseline configuration for development and test environments that is
          managed separately from the operational baseline configuration.</li>
