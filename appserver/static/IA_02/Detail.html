    <h1>IA-2 IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION (ORGANIZATIONAL USERS)</h1><br/>

    <h2>Control</h2>
    <p>
      The information system uniquely identifies and authenticates organizational users (or
      processes acting on behalf of organizational users).
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Supplemental Guidance</h2>
    <p>
      Organizational users include organizational employees or individuals the
      organization deems to have equivalent status of employees (e.g., contractors, guest researchers,
      individuals from allied nations). Users are uniquely identified and authenticated for all accesses
      other than those accesses explicitly identified and documented by the organization in AC-14.
      Unique identification of individuals in group accounts (e.g., shared privilege accounts) may need
      to be considered for detailed accountability of activity. Authentication of user identities is
      accomplished through the use of passwords, tokens, biometrics, or in the case of multifactor
      authentication, some combination thereof. Access to organizational information systems is
      defined as either local or network. Local access is any access to an organizational information
      system by a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) where such access is obtained by direct
      connection without the use of a network. Network access is any access to an organizational
      information system by a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) where such access is obtained
      through a network connection. Remote access is a type of network access which involves
      communication through an external network (e.g., the Internet). Internal networks include local
      area networks, wide area networks, and virtual private networks that are under the control of the
      organization. For a virtual private network (VPN), the VPN is considered an internal network if
      the organization establishes the VPN connection between organization-controlled endpoints in a
      manner that does not require the organization to depend on any external networks across which the
      VPN transits to protect the confidentiality and integrity of information transmitted. Identification
      and authentication requirements for information system access by other than organizational users
      are described in IA-8.
    </p>
    <p>
      The identification and authentication requirements in this control are satisfied by complying with
      Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 consistent with organization-specific implementation
      plans provided to OMB. In addition to identifying and authenticating users at the information-
      system level (i.e., at logon), identification and authentication mechanisms are employed at the
      application level, when necessary, to provide increased information security for the organization.
      Related controls: AC-14, AC-17, AC-18, IA-4, IA-5.

              individual/unique authenticator; and</li>

              group authenticator.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>The information system uses multifactor authentication for network access to privileged accounts
          where one of the factors is provided by a device separate from the information system being
          accessed.</li>
      <li>The information system uses multifactor authentication for network access to non-privileged
          accounts where one of the factors is provided by a device separate from the information system
          being accessed.</li>
      <li>The information system uses [Assignment: organization-defined replay-resistant authentication
          mechanisms] for network access to privileged accounts.
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u> An authentication process resists replay attacks if it is
          impractical to achieve a successful authentication by recording and replaying a previous
          authentication message. Techniques used to address this include protocols that use nonces or
          challenges (e.g., TLS), and time synchronous or challenge-response one-time authenticators.
