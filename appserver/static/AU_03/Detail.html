    <h1>AU-3 CONTENT OF AUDIT RECORDS</h1><br/>

    <h2>Control</h2>
    <p>
      The information system produces audit records that contain sufficient information to, at a
      minimum, establish what type of event occurred, when (date and time) the event occurred, where
      the event occurred, the source of the event, the outcome (success or failure) of the event, and the
      identity of any user/subject associated with the event.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Supplemental Guidance</h2>
    <p>
      Audit record content that may be necessary to satisfy the requirement of
      this control, includes, for example, time stamps, source and destination addresses, user/process
      identifiers, event descriptions, success/fail indications, filenames involved, and access control or
      flow control rules invoked. Related controls: AU-2, AU-8.
    </p>

    <h2>Control Enhancements</h2>
    <ol class="decimal">
      <li>The information system includes [Assignment: organization-defined additional, more detailed
          information] in the audit records for audit events identified by type, location, or subject.
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u> An example of detailed information that the organization
          may require in audit records is full-text recording of privileged commands or the individual
          identities of group account users.
        </p>

      <li>The organization centrally manages the content of audit records generated by [Assignment:
          organization-defined information system components].</li>
