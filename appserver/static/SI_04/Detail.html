    <h1>SI-4 INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING</h1><br/>

    <h2>Control</h2>
    <p>
      The organization:
      <ol class="loweralpha">
        <li>Monitors events on the information system in accordance with [Assignment: organization-
            defined monitoring objectives] and detects information system attacks;</li>
        <li>Identifies unauthorized use of the information system;</li>
        <li>Deploys monitoring devices: (i) strategically within the information system to collect
            organization-determined essential information; and (ii) at ad hoc locations within the system
            to track specific types of transactions of interest to the organization;</li>
        <li>Heightens the level of information system monitoring activity whenever there is an indication
            of increased risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, or
            the Nation based on law enforcement information, intelligence information, or other credible
            sources of information; and</li>
        <li>Obtains legal opinion with regard to information system monitoring activities in accordance
            with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, or regulations.</li>

    <h2>Supplemental Guidance</h2>
    <p>
      Information system monitoring includes external and internal monitoring.
      External monitoring includes the observation of events occurring at the system boundary (i.e., part
      of perimeter defense and boundary protection). Internal monitoring includes the observation of
      events occurring within the system (e.g., within internal organizational networks and system
      components). Information system monitoring capability is achieved through a variety of tools and
      techniques (e.g., intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems, malicious code
      protection software, audit record monitoring software, network monitoring software). Strategic
      locations for monitoring devices include, for example, at selected perimeter locations and near
      server farms supporting critical applications, with such devices typically being employed at the
      managed interfaces associated with controls SC-7 and AC-17. The Einstein network monitoring
      device from the Department of Homeland Security is an example of a system monitoring device.
      The granularity of the information collected is determined by the organization based on its
      monitoring objectives and the capability of the information system to support such activities. An
      example of a specific type of transaction of interest to the organization with regard to monitoring
      is Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) traffic that bypasses organizational HTTP proxies, when
      use of such proxies is required. Related controls: AC-4, AC-8, AC-17, AU-2, AU-6, SI-3, SI-7.

    <h2>Control Enhancements</h2>
    <ol class="decimal">
      <li>The organization interconnects and configures individual intrusion detection tools into a
          systemwide intrusion detection system using common protocols.</li>
      <li>The organization employs automated tools to support near real-time analysis of events.</li>
      <li>The organization employs automated tools to integrate intrusion detection tools into access
          control and flow control mechanisms for rapid response to attacks by enabling reconfiguration of
          these mechanisms in support of attack isolation and elimination.</li>
      <li>The information system monitors inbound and outbound communications for unusual or
          unauthorized activities or conditions.
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u>
          Unusual/unauthorized activities or conditions include, for
          example, internal traffic that indicates the presence of malicious code within an information
          system or propagating among system components, the unauthorized export of information, or
          signaling to an external information system. Evidence of malicious code is used to identify
          potentially compromised information systems or information system components.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>The information system provides near real-time alerts when the following indications of
          compromise or potential compromise occur: [Assignment: organization-defined list of compromise
          indicators].
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u>
          Alerts may be generated, depending on the organization-
          defined list of indicators, from a variety of sources, for example, audit records or input from
          malicious code protection mechanisms, intrusion detection or prevention mechanisms, or
          boundary protection devices such as firewalls, gateways, and routers.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>The information system prevents non-privileged users from circumventing intrusion detection and
          prevention capabilities.</li>
      <li>The information system notifies [Assignment: organization-defined list of incident response
          personnel (identified by name and/or by role)] of suspicious events and takes [Assignment:
          organization-defined list of least-disruptive actions to terminate suspicious events].
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u>
          The least-disruptive actions may include initiating a
          request for human response.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>The organization protects information obtained from intrusion-monitoring tools from unauthorized
          access, modification, and deletion.</li>
      <li>The organization tests/exercises intrusion-monitoring tools [Assignment: organization-defined
          time-period].
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u>
          The frequency of testing/exercises is dependent upon the
          type and method of deployment of the intrusion-monitoring tools.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>The organization makes provisions so that encrypted traffic is visible to information system
          monitoring tools.
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u>
          The enhancement recognizes the need to balance
          encrypting traffic versus the need to have insight into that traffic from a monitoring
          perspective. For some organizations, the need to ensure the confidentiality of traffic is
          paramount; for others, the mission-assurance concerns are greater.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>The organization analyzes outbound communications traffic at the external boundary of the system
          (i.e., system perimeter) and, as deemed necessary, at selected interior points within the system
          (e.g., subnets, subsystems) to discover anomalies.
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u>
          Anomalies within the information system include, for
          example, large file transfers, long-time persistent connections, unusual protocols and ports in
          use, and attempted communications with suspected malicious external addresses.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>The organization employs automated mechanisms to alert security personnel of the following
          inappropriate or unusual activities with security implications: [Assignment: organization-defined
          list of inappropriate or unusual activities that trigger alerts].</li>
      <li>The organization:
        <ol class="loweralpha">
          <li>Analyzes communications traffic/event patterns for the information system;</li>
          <li>Develops profiles representing common traffic patterns and/or events; and</li>
          <li>Uses the traffic/event profiles in tuning system-monitoring devices to reduce the number of
              false positives to [Assignment: organization-defined measure of false positives] and the
              number of false negatives to [Assignment: organization-defined measure of false negatives].</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>The organization employs a wireless intrusion detection system to identify rogue wireless devices
          and to detect attack attempts and potential compromises/breaches to the information system.</li>
      <li>The organization employs an intrusion detection system to monitor wireless communications
          traffic as the traffic passes from wireless to wireline networks.</li>
      <li>The organization correlates information from monitoring tools employed throughout the
          information system to achieve organization-wide situational awareness.</li>
      <li>The organization correlates results from monitoring physical, cyber, and supply chain activities to
          achieve integrated situational awareness.
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u>
          Integrated situational awareness enhances the capability
          of the organization to more quickly detect sophisticated attacks and investigate the methods
          and techniques employed to carry out the attacks.
