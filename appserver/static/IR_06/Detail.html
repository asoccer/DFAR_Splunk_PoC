    <h2>Control</h2>
    <p>
      The organization:<br/>
      <ol class="loweralpha">
        <li>Requires personnel to report suspected security incidents to the organizational incident
            response capability within [Assignment: organization-defined time-period]; and</li>
        <li>Reports security incident information to designated authorities.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Supplemental Guidance</h2>
    <p>
      The intent of this control is to address both specific incident reporting
      requirements within an organization and the formal incident reporting requirements for federal
      agencies and their subordinate organizations. The types of security incidents reported, the content
      and timeliness of the reports, and the list of designated reporting authorities are consistent with
      applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and
      guidance. Current federal policy requires that all federal agencies (unless specifically exempted
      from such requirements) report security incidents to the United States Computer Emergency
      Readiness Team (US-CERT) within specified time frames designated in the US-CERT Concept of
      Operations for Federal Cyber Security Incident Handling. Related controls: IR-4, IR-5.
