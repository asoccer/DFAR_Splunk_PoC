    <h1>CP-9 INFORMATION SYSTEM BACKUP</h1><br/>

    <h2>Control</h2>
    <p>
      The organization:
      <ol class="loweralpha">
        <li>Conducts backups of user-level information contained in the information system [Assignment:
            organization-defined frequency consistent with recovery time and recovery point objectives];</li>
        <li>Conducts backups of system-level information contained in the information system
            [Assignment: organization-defined frequency consistent with recovery time and recovery
            point objectives];</li>
        <li>Conducts backups of information system documentation including security-related
            documentation [Assignment: organization-defined frequency consistent with recovery time
            and recovery point objectives]; and</li>
        <li>Protects the confidentiality and integrity of backup information at the storage location.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Supplemental Guidance</h2>
    <p>
      System-level information includes, for example, system-state information,
      operating system and application software, and licenses. Digital signatures and cryptographic
      hashes are examples of mechanisms that can be employed by organizations to protect the integrity
      of information system backups. An organizational assessment of risk guides the use of encryption
      for protecting backup information. The protection of system backup information while in transit is
      beyond the scope of this control. Related controls: CP-6, MP-4.

  <div>
    <h2>Control Enhancements</h2>
    <ol class="decimal">
      <li>The organization tests backup information [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] to verify
          media reliability and information integrity.</li>
      <li>The organization uses a sample of backup information in the restoration of selected information
          system functions as part of contingency plan testing.</li>
      <li>The organization stores backup copies of the operating system and other critical information
          system software, as well as copies of the information system inventory (including hardware,
          software, and firmware components) in a separate facility or in a fire-rated container that is not
          colocated with the operational system.</li>
      <li>[Withdrawn: Incorporated into CP-9].
      <li>The organization transfers information system backup information to the alternate storage site
          [Assignment: organization-defined time period and transfer rate consistent with the recovery time
          and recovery point objectives].</li>
      <li>The organization accomplishes information system backup by maintaining a redundant secondary
          system, not collocated, that can be activated without loss of information or disruption to the
          operation.</li>
