    <h2>Control</h2>
    <p>

      consistent with records retention policy] to provide support for after-the-fact investigations of
      security incidents and to meet regulatory and organizational information retention requirements.

    <h2>Supplemental Guidance</h2>
    <p>
      The organization retains audit records until it is determined that they are no
      longer needed for administrative, legal, audit, or other operational purposes. This includes, for
      example, retention and availability of audit records relative to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)
      requests, subpoena, and law enforcement actions. Standard categorizations of audit records
      relative to such types of actions and standard response processes for each type of action are
      developed and disseminated. The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA)
      General Records Schedules (GRS) provide federal policy on record retention.
