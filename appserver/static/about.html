    <h1>General</h1>

    <p>
      The FISMA app provides reports and searches that are relevant to NIST 800-53 revision 3 guidelines, in order to automate
      compliance reporting.  The app leverages CIM
      (<a href="http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Knowledge/UnderstandandusetheCommonInformationModel">Common Information Model</a>)
      extractions and tagging, which are generally provided in the form of "Technology Add-ons" by Splunk, or can be built as needed.
      Each control references a help page which describes the tags and fields used in order to populate search results and drive visualizations.
    </p>

    <p>
      This app utilizes search macros in order to provide flexibility and customizability to the end-user.  Macros contain 2
      separate filtering mechanisms.  The first utilizes arguments, i.e. <b>`vulnerability_scan("severity=high")`</b>, while the
      second utilizes a similarly named filter macro and is intended for more permanent filtering, i.e. <b>`vulnerability_scan_filter`</b>
      whose definition should be customized as needed for the purposes of permanent search modifications.  Additionally, summary
      indexing generation is executed via macros with a "sg_" prefix to the macro name, while summary index searching is executed
      via macros with an "ss_" prefix.  For example, <b>`sg_vulnerability_scan`</b> is used by a savedsearch in order to populate
      the summary index, while views will use <b>`ss_vulnerability_scan`</b> for the search of the previously generated summary index data.
    </p>

    <p>
      This app contains scheduled searches which populate the summary indexes: fisma_access_summary, fisma_account_summary,
      fisma_audit_summary, fisma_endpoint_summary, and fisma_network_summary.
      Most views automatically switch between live and summary indexed data, based on the selected time period.  If real-time mode, or any
      timeframe under 6 hours is selected, charts will be populated via live data.  However, if a 6 hour or greater time period is selected,
      the search will instead utilize summary indexes.  So, &gt;= 6h results in a call to the `ss_vulnerability_scan` macro, while any time
      period less than 6 hours will use the `vulnerability_scan` search instead.  In that case, the summary index data has been populated
      via a scheduled search which calls the macro `sg_vulnerability_scan`.  All of these elements can be modified as needed, but many
      modifications should be made to the included search macro filters instead, or to the underlying Technology Add-ons which perform
      field extractions, and create eventtypes and tags.

    <h1>Installation</h1>

    <p>
      The FISMA app is required to be present on the search head.  However, this app contains scheduled searches which populate the
      summary indexes: fisma_access_summary, fisma_account_summary, fisma_audit_summary, fisma_endpoint_summary, and fisma_network_summary.
      By default, summary indexed data will reside on the search head, but the search head may be configured to
      forward the summary data down the indexers in a distributed environment.  Here's a splunkbase article regarding the subject:
      <a href="http://splunk-base.splunk.com/answers/7810/app-installation-scheduled-searches-summary-index-and-search-heads">
        http://splunk-base.splunk.com/answers/7810/app-installation-scheduled-searches-summary-index-and-search-heads
      </a>
    </p>

    <p>
      Please consult the README file for any technology add-ons in order to determine their installation requirements
      such as the <a href="http://splunk-base.splunk.com/apps/28933/splunk-for-windows-technology-add-on">Splunk for Windows Technology Add-on</a>
      and the <a href="http://splunk-base.splunk.com/apps/33800/splunk-for-unix-and-linux-technology-add-on">Splunk for Unix and Linux Technology Add-on</a>
    </p>

    <p>
      It is not required to backfill summary indexes, but a script (bin/backfill_summary_indexes.sh) is provided if needed.

    <h1>Customization</h1>

    <p>
      As an example of adding a new data source which provides vulnerability data that you'd like to include in the canned 
      reports, we can start by looking at the required tags for the control in question.  In the case of vulnerability scans
      we start with creating a new TA for our data (e.g. TA-scanner).  The TA should extract fields properly, and create an eventtype which
      provides access to the correct data.
    </p>

    <p>
      The following eventtype definition is simple and the expectation is that any search results of "sourcetype=nessus" will
      contain a valid vulnerability/issue on a single endpoint.<br/><br/>

      <pre>
        # eventtypes.conf
        [nessus]
        search = sourcetype=nessus
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Tags are associated to the eventtype created above and will be the primary search used within relevant
      dashboards.  Executing the search: "tag=network tag=vulnerability tag=report", should yield a minimum of the same
      results as "sourcetype=nessus".  However, these tags may be applied to multiple data sources and therefore eventtypes.
      This is the strength of using this method -- new data sources can be added as needed without needing to modify
      the included dashboards and canned searches.<br/><br/>

      <pre>
        # tags.conf
        [eventtype=nessus]
        network = enabled
        vulnerability = enabled
        report = enabled
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Additionally, you should ensure that the necessary fields are present, if possible,
      though the lack of fields has generally been accounted for with a "fillnull" statement.  These field extractions are
      performed within the "Technology Add-on" and follow the "Common Information Model" noted above.  In this case:<br/>

      <ul>
        <li><b>dest</b> = the scanned host</li>
        <li><b>dest_ip</b> = the host's IP address</li>
        <li><b>dest_port</b> = the host's vulnerable network port</li>
        <li><b>dest_port_proto</b> = the host's vulnerable network port protocol</li>
        <li><b>os</b> = operating system name, if present</li>
        <li><b>severity</b> = severity of the vulnerability, extracted from the event data</li>
        <li><b>signature</b> = text describing the vulnerability</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>For further reference, the specific eventtypes, tags, and fields required for each dashboard are
        included in each control's "Help" page.</b>
    </p>

    <h1>Lookups</h1>

    <p>
      The FISMA app utilizes 2 lookups: account_mapping.csv and privileged_commands.csv.  Please ensure that
      these lookups are properly configured.
    </p>

    <p>
      Following is an example account_mapping.csv.  This lookup is intended to add account type and organizational
      information to a <b>user</b> attribute.  This lookup uses wildcard values and undefined accounts will default
      to "individual". If desired, the lookup may be converted to a "dynamic" or "scripted" lookup in order to integrate
      with identity management systems.  Controls which utilize this lookup state as much within their "Help" page.<br/>

      <pre>
      user,account_type,organization
      *$,system,
      administrator,system,
      root,system,
      guest,guest,
      temp,temporary,
      apache,application,
      webdev,group,
      philjackson,individual,Agency X
      bruce.lee,individual,Agency Y
      *,individual,
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Lastly, this is a short exerpt from the privileged_commands.csv lookup, which specifies whether an
      <b>app</b> attribute is a privileged command. Controls which utilize this lookup state as much within their "Help" page.<br/>

      <pre>
      app,is_privileged
      arp.exe,true 
      at.exe,true
      attrib.exe,true
      ...
      </pre>
  </div>
