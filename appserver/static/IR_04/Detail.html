    <h2>Control</h2>
    <p>
      The organization:<br/>
      <ol class="loweralpha">
        <li>Implements an incident handling capability for security incidents that includes preparation,
            detection and analysis, containment, eradication, and recovery;</li>
        <li>Coordinates incident handling activities with contingency planning activities; and</li>
        <li>Incorporates lessons learned from ongoing incident handling activities into incident response
            procedures, training, and testing/exercises, and implements the resulting changes accordingly.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Supplemental Guidance</h2>
    <p>
      Incident-related information can be obtained from a variety of sources
      including, but not limited to, audit monitoring, network monitoring, physical access monitoring,
      and user/administrator reports. Related controls: AU-6, CP-2, IR-2, IR-3, PE-6, SC-5, SC-7, SI-3,
      SI-4, SI-7.

    <h2>Control Enhancements</h2>
    <ol class="digit">
      <li>The organization employs automated mechanisms to support the incident handling process.
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u>
          An online incident management system is an example of an automated mechanism.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>The organization includes dynamic reconfiguration of the information system as part of the
          incident response capability.
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u>
          Dynamic reconfiguration includes, for example, changes
          to router rules, access control lists, intrusion detection/prevention system parameters, and
          filter rules for firewalls and gateways.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>The organization identifies classes of incidents and defines appropriate actions to take in response
          to ensure continuation of organizational missions and business functions.
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u>
          Classes of incidents include, for example, malfunctions
          due to design/implementation errors and omissions, targeted malicious attacks, and untargeted
          malicious attacks. Incident response actions that may be appropriate include, for example,
          graceful degradation, information system shutdown, fall back to manual mode or alternative
          technology whereby the system operates differently, employing deceptive measures (e.g.,
          false data flows, false status measures), alternate information flows, or operating in a mode
          that is reserved solely for when a system is under attack.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>The organization correlates incident information and individual incident responses to achieve an
          organization-wide perspective on incident awareness and response.</li>
      <li>The organization implements a configurable capability to automatically disable the information
          system if any of the following security violations are detected: [Assignment: organization-defined
          list of security violations].</li>
