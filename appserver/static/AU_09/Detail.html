    <h1>AU-9 PROTECTION OF AUDIT INFORMATION</h1><br/>

    <h2>Control</h2>
    <p>
      The information system protects audit information and audit tools from unauthorized
      access, modification, and deletion.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Supplemental Guidance</h2>
    <p>
      Audit information includes all information (e.g., audit records, audit
      settings, and audit reports) needed to successfully audit information system activity. Related
      controls: AC-3, AC-6.

    <ol class="decimal">
      <li>The information system produces audit records on hardware-enforced, write-once media.</li>
      <li>The information system backs up audit records [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] onto
          a different system or media than the system being audited.</li>
      <li>The information system uses cryptographic mechanisms to protect the integrity of audit
          information and audit tools.
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u> An example of a cryptographic mechanism for the
          protection of integrity is the computation and application of a cryptographic-signed hash
          using asymmetric cryptography, protecting the confidentiality of the key used to generate the
          hash, and using the public key to verify the hash information.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>The organization:
        <ol class="loweralpha">
          <li>Authorizes access to management of audit functionality to only a limited subset of privileged
              users; and</li>
          <li>Protects the audit records of non-local accesses to privileged accounts and the execution of
              privileged functions.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u> Auditing may not be reliable when performed by the
          information system to which the user being audited has privileged access. The privileged user
          may inhibit auditing or modify audit records. This control enhancement helps mitigate this
          risk by requiring that privileged access be further defined between audit-related privileges and
          other privileges, thus, limiting the users with audit-related privileges. Reducing the risk of
          audit compromises by privileged users can also be achieved, for example, by performing audit
          activity on a separate information system or by using storage media that cannot be modified
          (e.g., write-once recording devices).
