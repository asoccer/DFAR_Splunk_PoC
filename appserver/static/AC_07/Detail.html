    <h2>Control</h2>
    <p>
      The information system:<br/>
      <ol class="loweralpha">
        <li>Enforces a limit of [Assignment: organization-defined number] consecutive invalid access
            attempts by a user during a [Assignment: organization-defined time period]; and</li>
        <li>Automatically [Selection: locks the account/node for an [Assignment: organization-defined
            time period]; locks the account/node until released by an administrator; delays next login
            prompt according to [Assignment: organization-defined delay algorithm]] when the maximum number
            of unsuccessful attempts is exceeded. The control applies regardless of whether the login occurs
            via a local or network connection.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Supplemental Guidance</h2>
    <p>
      Due to the potential for denial of service, automatic lockouts initiated by
      the information system are usually temporary and automatically release after a predetermined time
      period established by the organization. If a delay algorithm is selected, the organization may
      chose to employ different algorithms for different information system components based on the
      capabilities of those components. Response to unsuccessful login attempts may be implemented
      at both the operating system and the application levels. This control applies to all accesses other
      than those accesses explicitly identified and documented by the organization in AC-14.

    <h2>Control Enhancements</h2>
    <ol class="decimal">
      <li>The information system automatically locks the account/node until released by an administrator
          when the maximum number of unsuccessful attempts is exceeded.</li>
      <li>The information system provides additional protection for mobile devices accessed via login by
          purging information from the device after [Assignment: organization-defined number] consecutive,
          unsuccessful login attempts to the device.
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u> This enhancement applies only to mobile devices for
          which a login occurs (e.g., personal digital assistants) and not to mobile devices accessed
          without a login such as removable media. In certain situations, this enhancement may not
          apply to mobile devices if the information on the device is encrypted with sufficiently strong
          encryption mechanisms, making purging unnecessary. The login is to the mobile device, not
          to any one account on the device. Therefore, a successful login to any account on the mobile
          device resets the unsuccessful login count to zero.
