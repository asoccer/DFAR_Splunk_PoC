    <h2>Control</h2>
    <p>
      The organization:<br/>
      <ol class="loweralpha">
        <li>Documents allowed methods of remote access to the information system;</li>
        <li>Establishes usage restrictions and implementation guidance for each allowed remote access method;</li>
        <li>Monitors for unauthorized remote access to the information system;</li>
        <li>Authorizes remote access to the information system prior to connection; and</li>
        <li>Enforces requirements for remote connections to the information system.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Supplemental Guidance</h2>
    <p>
      This control requires explicit authorization prior to allowing remote access
      to an information system without specifying a specific format for that authorization. For example,
      while the organization may deem it appropriate to use a system interconnection agreement to
      authorize a given remote access, such agreements are not required by this control. Remote access
      is any access to an organizational information system by a user (or process acting on behalf of a
      user) communicating through an external network (e.g., the Internet). Examples of remote access
      methods include dial-up, broadband, and wireless (see AC-18 for wireless access). A virtual
      private network when adequately provisioned with appropriate security controls, is considered an
      internal network (i.e., the organization establishes a network connection between organization-
      controlled endpoints in a manner that does not require the organization to depend on external
      networks to protect the confidentiality or integrity of information transmitted across the network).
      Remote access controls are applicable to information systems other than public web servers or
      systems specifically designed for public access. Enforcing access restrictions associated with
      remote connections is accomplished by control AC-3. Related controls: AC-3, AC-18, AC-20,
      IA-2, IA-3, IA-8, MA-4.

    <h2>Control Enhancements</h2>
    <ol class="decimal">
      <li>The organization employs automated mechanisms to facilitate the monitoring and control of
          remote access methods.
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u> Automated monitoring of remote access sessions allows
          organizations to audit user activities on a variety of information system components (e.g.,
          servers, workstations, notebook/laptop computers) and to ensure compliance with remote
          access policy.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>The organization uses cryptography to protect the confidentiality and integrity of remote access
          sessions.
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u>The encryption strength of mechanism is selected based
          on the security categorization of the information. Related controls: SC-8, SC-9, SC-13.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>The information system routes all remote accesses through a limited number of managed access
          control points.
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u> Related control: SC-7.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>The organization authorizes the execution of privileged commands and access to security-relevant
          information via remote access only for compelling operational needs and documents the rationale
          for such access in the security plan for the information system.
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u> Related control: AC-6.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>The organization monitors for unauthorized remote connections to the information system
          [Assignment: organization-defined frequency], and takes appropriate action if an unauthorized
          connection is discovered.</li>
      <li>The organization ensures that users protect information about remote access mechanisms from
          unauthorized use and disclosure.</li>
      <li>The organization ensures that remote sessions for accessing [Assignment: organization-defined
          list of security functions and security-relevant information] employ [Assignment: organization-
          defined additional security measures] and are audited.
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u> Additional security measures are typically above and
          beyond standard bulk or session layer encryption (e.g., Secure Shell [SSH], Virtual Private
          Networking [VPN] with blocking mode enabled). Related controls: SC-8, SC-9.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>The organization disables [Assignment: organization-defined networking protocols within the
          information system deemed to be nonsecure] except for explicitly identified components in
          support of specific operational requirements.
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u> The organization can either make a determination of the
          relative security of the networking protocol or base the security decision on the assessment of
          other entities. Bluetooth and peer-to-peer networking are examples of less than secure
          networking protocols.
