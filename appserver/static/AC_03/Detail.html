    <h2>Supplemental Guidance</h2>
    <p>
      Supplemental Guidance: Access control policies (e.g., identity-based policies, role-based policies,
      attribute-based policies) and access enforcement mechanisms (e.g., access control lists, access
      control matrices, cryptography) are employed by organizations to control access between users (or
      processes acting on behalf of users) and objects (e.g., devices, files, records, processes, programs,
      domains) in the information system. In addition to enforcing authorized access at the information-system
      level, access enforcement mechanisms are employed at the application level, when
      necessary, to provide increased information security for the organization. Consideration is given
      to the implementation of an audited, explicit override of automated mechanisms in the event of
      emergencies or other serious events. If encryption of stored information is employed as an access
      enforcement mechanism, the cryptography used is FIPS 140-2 (as amended) compliant. For
      classified information, the cryptography used is largely dependent on the classification level of the
      information and the clearances of the individuals having access to the information. Mechanisms
      implemented by AC-3 are configured to enforce authorizations determined by other security
      controls. Related controls: AC-2, AC-4, AC-5, AC-6, AC-16, AC-17, AC-18, AC-19, AC-20,
      AC-21, AC-22, AU-9, CM-5, CM-6, MA-3, MA-4, MA-5, SA-7, SC-13, SI-9.<br/>

    <h2>Control Enhancements</h2>
    <ol class="decimal">
      <li>[Withdrawn: Incorporated into AC-6].</li>
      <li>The information system enforces dual authorization, based on organizational policies and
          procedures for [Assignment: organization-defined privileged commands].
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u>
          Dual authorization mechanisms require two forms of approval to execute.
          The organization does not employ dual authorization mechanisms when
          an immediate response is necessary to ensure public and environmental safety.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>The information system enforces [Assignment: organization-defined nondiscretionary access
          control policies] over [Assignment: organization-defined set of users and resources] where
          the policy rule set for each policy specifies:
        <ol class="loweralpha">
          <li>Access control information (i.e., attributes) employed by the policy rule set (e.g., position,
              nationality, age, project, time of day); and</li>
          <li>Required relationships among the access control information to permit access.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u>
          Nondiscretionary access control policies that may be
          implemented by organizations include, for example, Attribute-Based Access Control,
          Mandatory Access Control, and Originator Controlled Access Control. Nondiscretionary
          access control policies may be employed by organizations in addition to the employment of
          discretionary access control policies.
        </p>
        <p>
          For Mandatory Access Control (MAC): Policy establishes coverage over all subjects and
          objects under its control to ensure that each user receives only that information to which the
          user is authorized access based on classification of the information, and on user clearance and
          formal access authorization. The information system assigns appropriate security attributes
          (e.g., labels/security domains/types) to subjects and objects, and uses these attributes as the
          basis for MAC decisions. The Bell-LaPadula security model defines allowed access with
          regard to an organization-defined set of strictly hierarchical security levels as follows: A
          subject can read an object only if the security level of the subject dominates the security level
          of the object and a subject can write to an object only if two conditions are met: the security
          level of the object dominates the security level of the subject, and the security level of the
          user's clearance dominates the security level of the object (no read up, no write down).
        </p>
        <p>
          For Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Policy establishes coverage over all users and
          resources to ensure that access rights are grouped by role name, and access to resources is
          restricted to users who have been authorized to assume the associated role.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>The information system enforces a Discretionary Access Control (DAC) policy that:
        <ol class="loweralpha">
          <li>Allows users to specify and control sharing by named individuals or groups of individuals, or by both;</li>
          <li>Limits propagation of access rights; and</li>
          <li>Includes or excludes access to the granularity of a single user.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>The information system prevents access to [Assignment: organization-defined security-relevant
          information] except during secure, nonoperable system states.
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u>
          Security-relevant information is any information within the information system that can
          potentially impact the operation of security functions in a manner that could result in
          failure to enforce the system security policy or maintain isolation of code and data.
          Filtering rules for routers and firewalls, cryptographic key management
          information, key configuration parameters for security services, and access control lists are
          examples of security-relevant information. Secure, nonoperable system states are states in
          which the information system is not performing mission/business-related processing (e.g., the
          system is off-line for maintenance, troubleshooting, boot-up, shutdown).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>The organization encrypts or stores off-line in a secure location [Assignment: organization-defined
          user and/or system information].
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u>
          The use of encryption by the organization reduces the
          probability of unauthorized disclosure of information and can also detect unauthorized
          changes to information. Removing information from online storage to offline storage
          eliminates the possibility of individuals gaining unauthorized access via a network. Related
          control: MP-4.
