      The organization:
      <ol class="loweralpha">
        <li>Reviews and analyzes information system audit records [Assignment: organization-defined
            frequency] for indications of inappropriate or unusual activity, and reports findings to
            designated organizational officials; and</li>
        <li>Adjusts the level of audit review, analysis, and reporting within the information system when
            there is a change in risk to organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, other
            organizations, or the Nation based on law enforcement information, intelligence information,
            or other credible sources of information.</li>

    <h2>Control Enhancements</h2>
    <ol class="decimal">
      <li>The information system integrates audit review, analysis, and reporting processes to support
          organizational processes for investigation and response to suspicious activities.</li>
      <li>[Withdrawn: Incorporated into SI-4].</li>
      <li>The organization analyzes and correlates audit records across different repositories to gain
          organization-wide situational awareness.</li>
      <li>The information system centralizes the review and analysis of audit records from multiple
          components within the system.
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u> An example of an automated mechanism for centralized
          review and analysis is a Security Information Management (SIM) product. Related control: AU-2.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>The organization integrates analysis of audit records with analysis of vulnerability scanning
          information, performance data, and network monitoring information to further enhance the ability
          to identify inappropriate or unusual activity.
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u> A Security Event/Information Management system tool
          can facilitate audit record tralizes the review and analysis of audit records from multiple
          information system components as well as audit record correlation and analysis. The use of standardized
          audit record analysis scripts developed by the organization (with localized script adjustments, as
          necessary), provides a more cost-effective approach for analyzing audit record information
          collected. The correlation of audit record information with vulnerability scanning information
          is important in determining the veracity of the vulnerability scans and correlating attack
          detection events with scanning results. Related control: AU-7, RA-5, SI-4.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>The organization correlates information from audit records with information obtained from
          monitoring physical access to further enhance the ability to identify suspicious, inappropriate,
          unusual, or malevolent activity.

      <li>The organization specifies the permitted actions for each authorized information system process,
          role, and/or user in the audit and accountability policy.
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u> Permitted actions for information system processes, roles,
          and/or users associated with the review, analysis, and reporting of audit records include, for

      <li>The organization employs automated mechanisms to alert security personnel of the following
          inappropriate or unusual activities with security implications: [Assignment: organization-defined
          list of inappropriate or unusual activities that are to result in alerts].</li>
      <li>The organization performs, in a physically dedicated information system, full-text analysis of
