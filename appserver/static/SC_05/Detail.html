    <h1>SC-5 DENIAL OF SERVICE PROTECTION</h1><br/>

    <h2>Control</h2>
    <p>
      The information system protects against or limits the effects of the following types of
      denial of service attacks: [Assignment: organization-defined list of types of denial of service
      attacks or reference to source for current list].
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Supplemental Guidance</h2>
    <p>
      A variety of technologies exist to limit, or in some cases, eliminate the
      effects of denial of service attacks. For example, boundary protection devices can filter certain
      types of packets to protect devices on an organization's internal network from being directly
      affected by denial of service attacks. Employing increased capacity and bandwidth combined with
      service redundancy may reduce the susceptibility to some denial of service attacks. Related
      control: SC-7.

    <h2>Control Enhancements</h2>
    <ol class="decimal">
      <li>The information system restricts the ability of users to launch denial of service attacks against
          other information systems or networks.</li>
      <li>The information system manages excess capacity, bandwidth, or other redundancy to limit the
          effects of information flooding types of denial of service attacks.</li>
