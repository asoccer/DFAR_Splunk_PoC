    <h1>IA-2 IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION (ORGANIZATIONAL USERS)</h1><br/>

    <h2>Control</h2>
    <p>
      The information system uniquely identifies and authenticates non-organizational users (or
      processes acting on behalf of non-organizational users).

    <h2>Supplemental Guidance</h2>
    <p>
      Non-organizational users include all information system users other than
      organizational users explicitly covered by IA-2. Users are uniquely identified and authenticated
      for all accesses other than those accesses explicitly identified and documented by the organization
      in accordance with AC-14. In accordance with the E-Authentication E-Government initiative,
      authentication of non-organizational users accessing federal information systems may be required
      to protect federal, proprietary, or privacy-related information (with exceptions noted for national
      security systems). Accordingly, a risk assessment is used in determining the authentication needs
      of the organization. Scalability, practicality, and security are simultaneously considered in
      balancing the need to ensure ease of use for access to federal information and information systems
      with the need to protect and adequately mitigate risk to organizational operations, organizational
      assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. Identification and authentication
      requirements for information system access by organizational users are described in IA-2. Related
      controls: AC-14, AC-17, AC-18, MA-4.
