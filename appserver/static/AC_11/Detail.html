    <h2>Control</h2>
    <p>
      The information system:
      <ol class="loweralpha">
        <li>Prevents further access to the system by initiating a session lock after [Assignment:
        organization-defined time period] of inactivity or upon receiving a request from a user; and</li>
        <li>Retains the session lock until the user reestablishes access using established identification and
        authentication procedures.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Supplemental Guidance</h2>
    <p>
      A session lock is a temporary action taken when a user stops work and
      moves away from the immediate physical vicinity of the information system but does not want to
      log out because of the temporary nature of the absence. The session lock is implemented at the
      point where session activity can be determined. This is typically at the operating system-level, but
      may be at the application-level. A session lock is not a substitute for logging out of the
      information system, for example, if the organization requires users to log out at the end of the
      workday.

    <h2>Control Enhancements</h2>
    <ol class="decimal">
      <li>The information system session lock mechanism, when activated on a device with a display
      screen, places a publically viewable pattern onto the associated display, hiding what was
      previously visible on the screen.</li>
