    <h1>SC-7 BOUNDARY PROTECTION</h1><br/>

    <h2>Control</h2>
    <p>
      The information system:
      <ol class="loweralpha">
        <li>Monitors and controls communications at the external boundary of the system and at key
            internal boundaries within the system; and</li>
        <li>Connects to external networks or information systems only through managed interfaces
            consisting of boundary protection devices arranged in accordance with an organizational
            security architecture.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Supplemental Guidance</h2>
    <p>
      Restricting external web traffic only to organizational web servers within
      managed interfaces and prohibiting external traffic that appears to be spoofing an internal address
      as the source are examples of restricting and prohibiting communications. Managed interfaces
      employing boundary protection devices include, for example, proxies, gateways, routers, firewalls,
      guards, or encrypted tunnels arranged in an effective security architecture (e.g., routers protecting
      firewalls and application gateways residing on a protected subnetwork commonly referred to as a
      demilitarized zone or DMZ).
    </p>
    <p>
      The organization considers the intrinsically shared nature of commercial telecommunications
      services in the implementation of security controls associated with the use of such services.
      Commercial telecommunications services are commonly based on network components and
      consolidated management systems shared by all attached commercial customers, and may include
      third-party provided access lines and other service elements. Consequently, such interconnecting
      transmission services may represent sources of increased risk despite contract security provisions.
      Therefore, when this situation occurs, the organization either implements appropriate
      compensating security controls or explicitly accepts the additional risk. Related controls: AC-4,
      IR-4, SC-5.

    <h2>Control Enhancements</h2>
    <ol class="decimal">
      <li>The organization physically allocates publicly accessible information system components to
          separate subnetworks with separate physical network interfaces.
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u>
          Publicly accessible information system components include, for example, public web servers.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>The organization limits the number of access points to the information system to allow for more
          comprehensive monitoring of inbound and outbound communications and network traffic.
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u>
          The Trusted Internet Connection (TIC) initiative is an
          example of limiting the number of managed network access points.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>The organization:
        <ol class="loweralph">
          <li>Implements a managed interface for each external telecommunication service;</li>
          <li>Establishes a traffic flow policy for each managed interface;</li>
          <li>Employs security controls as needed to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the
              information being transmitted;</li>
          <li> Documents each exception to the traffic flow policy with a supporting mission/business need
              and duration of that need;</li>
          <li>Reviews exceptions to the traffic flow policy [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; and</li>
          <li>Removes traffic flow policy exceptions that are no longer supported by an explicit
              mission/business need.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>The information system at managed interfaces, denies network traffic by default and allows
          network traffic by exception (i.e., deny all, permit by exception).</li>
      <li>The organization prevents the unauthorized release of information outside of the information
          system boundary or any unauthorized communication through the information system boundary
          when there is an operational failure of the boundary protection mechanisms.</li>
      <li>The information system prevents remote devices that have established a non-remote connection
          with the system from communicating outside of that communications path with resources in
          external networks.
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u>
          This control enhancement is implemented within the
          remote device (e.g., notebook/laptop computer) via configuration settings that are not
          configurable by the user of that device. An example of a non-remote communications path
          from a remote device is a virtual private network. When a non-remote connection is
          established using a virtual private network, the configuration settings prevent split-tunneling.
          Split tunneling might otherwise be used by remote users to communicate with the information
          system as an extension of that system and to communicate with local resources such as a
          printer or file server. Since the remote device, when connected by a non-remote connection,
          becomes an extension of the information system, allowing dual communications paths such as
          split-tunneling would be, in effect, allowing unauthorized external connections into the
          system.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>The information system routes [Assignment: organization-defined internal communications traffic]
          to [Assignment: organization-defined external networks] through authenticated proxy servers
          within the managed interfaces of boundary protection devices.
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u>
          External networks are networks outside the control of the
          organization. Proxy servers support logging individual Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
          sessions and blocking specific Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), domain names, and
          Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Proxy servers are also configurable with organization-
          defined lists of authorized and unauthorized websites.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>The information system, at managed interfaces, denies network traffic and audits internal users (or
          malicious code) posing a threat to external information systems.
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u>
          Detecting internal actions that may pose a security threat
          to external information systems is sometimes termed extrusion detection. Extrusion detection
          at the information system boundary includes the analysis of network traffic (incoming as well
          as outgoing) looking for indications of an internal threat to the security of external systems.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>The organization prevents the unauthorized exfiltration of information across managed interfaces.
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u>
          Measures to prevent unauthorized exfiltration of
          information from the information system include, for example: (i) strict adherence to protocol
          formats; (ii) monitoring for indications of beaconing from the information system; (iii)
          monitoring for use of steganography; (iv) disconnecting external network interfaces except
          when explicitly needed; (v) disassembling and reassembling packet headers; and (vi)
          employing traffic profile analysis to detect deviations from the volume or types of traffic
          expected within the organization. Examples of devices enforcing strict adherence to protocol
          formats include, for example, deep packet inspection firewalls and XML gateways. These
          devices verify adherence to the protocol specification at the application layer and serve to
          identify vulnerabilities that cannot be detected by devices operating at the network or
          transport layer.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>The information system checks incoming communications to ensure that the communications are
          coming from an authorized source and routed to an authorized destination.</li>
      <li>The information system implements host-based boundary protection mechanisms for servers,
          workstations, and mobile devices.
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u>
          A host-based boundary protection mechanism is, for
          example, a host-based firewall. Host-based boundary protection mechanisms are employed
          on mobile devices, such as notebook/laptop computers, and other types of mobile devices
          where such boundary protection mechanisms are available.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>The organization isolates [Assignment: organization defined key information security tools,
          mechanisms, and support components] from other internal information system components via
          physically separate subnets with managed interfaces to other portions of the system.</li>
      <li>The organization protects against unauthorized physical connections across the boundary
          protections implemented at [Assignment: organization-defined list of managed interfaces].
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u>
          Information systems operating at different security
          categories may routinely share common physical and environmental controls, since the
          systems may share space within organizational facilities. In practice, it is possible that these
          separate information systems may share common equipment rooms, wiring closets, and cable
          distribution paths. Protection against unauthorized physical connections can be achieved, for
          example, by employing clearly identified and physically separated cable trays, connection
          frames, and patch panels for each side of managed interfaces with physical access controls
          enforcing limited authorized access to these items. Related control: PE-4.
        </p>
      <li>
      <li>The information system routes all networked, privileged accesses through a dedicated, managed
          interface for purposes of access control and auditing.
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u>
          Related controls: AC-2, AC-3, AC-4, AU-2.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>The information system prevents discovery of specific system components (or devices)
          composing a managed interface.
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u>
          This control enhancement is intended to protect the
          network addresses of information system components that are part of the managed interface
          from discovery through common tools and techniques used to identify devices on a network.
          The network addresses are not available for discovery (e.g., not published or entered in the
          domain name system), requiring prior knowledge for access. Another obfuscation technique
          is to periodically change network addresses.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>The organization employs automated mechanisms to enforce strict adherence to protocol format.
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u>
          Automated mechanisms used to enforce protocol formats
          include, for example, deep packet inspection firewalls and XML gateways. These devices
          verify adherence to the protocol specification (e.g., IEEE) at the application layer and serve to
          identify significant vulnerabilities that cannot be detected by devices operating at the network
          or transport layer.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>The information system fails securely in the event of an operational failure of a boundary
          protection device.
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u>
          Fail secure is a condition achieved by the application of a
          set of information system mechanisms to ensure that in the event of an operational failure of a
          boundary protection device at a managed interface (e.g., router, firewall, guard, application
          gateway residing on a protected subnetwork commonly referred to as a demilitarized zone),
          the system does not enter into an unsecure state where intended security properties no longer
          hold. A failure of a boundary protection device cannot lead to, or cause information external
          to the boundary protection device to enter the device, nor can a failure permit unauthorized
          information release.
