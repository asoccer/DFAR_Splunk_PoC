    <h1>AC-4 INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT</h1><br/>

    <h2>Control</h2>
    <p>
      The information system enforces approved authorizations for controlling the flow of
      information within the system and between interconnected systems in accordance with applicable
      policy.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Supplemental Guidance</h2>
    <p>
      Information flow control regulates where information is allowed to travel
      within an information system and between information systems (as opposed to who is allowed to
      access the information) and without explicit regard to subsequent accesses to that information. A
      few examples of flow control restrictions include: keeping export controlled information from
      being transmitted in the clear to the Internet, blocking outside traffic that claims to be from within
      the organization, and not passing any web requests to the Internet that are not from the internal
      web proxy. Information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms are commonly
      employed by organizations to control the flow of information between designated sources and
      destinations (e.g., networks, individuals, devices) within information systems and between
      interconnected systems. Flow control is based on the characteristics of the information and/or the
      information path. Specific examples of flow control enforcement can be found in boundary
      protection devices (e.g., proxies, gateways, guards, encrypted tunnels, firewalls, and routers) that
      employ rule sets or establish configuration settings that restrict information system services,
      provide a packet-filtering capability based on header information, or message-filtering capability
      based on content (e.g., using key word searches or document characteristics). Mechanisms
      implemented by AC-4 are configured to enforce authorizations determined by other security
      controls. Related controls: AC-17, AC-19, AC-21, CM-7, SA-8, SC-2, SC-5, SC-7, SC-18.

    <h2>Control Enhancements</h2>
    <ol class="decimal">
      <li>The information system enforces information flow control using explicit security attributes on
          information, source, and destination objects as a basis for flow control decisions.
          Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Information flow enforcement mechanisms compare
          security attributes on all information (data content and data structure), source and destination
          objects, and respond appropriately (e.g., block, quarantine, alert administrator) when the
          mechanisms encounter information flows not explicitly allowed by the information flow
          policy. Information flow enforcement using explicit security attributes can be used, for
          example, to control the release of certain types of information.</li>
      <li>The information system enforces information flow control using protected processing domains
          (e.g., domain type-enforcement) as a basis for flow control decisions.</li>
      <li>The information system enforces dynamic information flow control based on policy that allows or
          disallows information flows based on changing conditions or operational considerations.</li>
      <li>The information system prevents encrypted data from bypassing content-checking mechanisms.</li>
      <li>The information system enforces [Assignment: organization-defined limitations on the embedding
          of data types within other data types].</li>
      <li>The information system enforces information flow control on metadata.</li>
      <li>The information system enforces [Assignment: organization-defined one-way flows] using
          hardware mechanisms.</li>
      <li>The information system enforces information flow control using [Assignment: organization-defined
          security policy filters] as a basis for flow control decisions.
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u>
          Organization-defined security policy filters include, for
          example, dirty word filters, file type checking filters, structured data filters, unstructured data
          filters, metadata content filters, and hidden content filters. Structured data permits the
          interpretation of its content by virtue of atomic elements that are understandable by an
          application and indivisible. Unstructured data refers to masses of (usually) digital information
          that does not have a data structure or has a data structure that is not easily readable by a
          machine. Unstructured data consists of two basic categories: (i) bitmap objects that are
          inherently non language-based (i.e., image, video, or audio files); and (ii) textual objects that
          are based on a written or printed language (i.e., commercial off-the-shelf word processing
          documents, spreadsheets, or emails).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>The information system enforces the use of human review for [Assignment: organization-defined
          security policy filters] when the system is not capable of making an information flow control
          decision.</li>
      <li>The information system provides the capability for a privileged administrator to enable/disable
          [Assignment: organization-defined security policy filters].</li>
      <li>The information system provides the capability for a privileged administrator to configure
          [Assignment: organization-defined security policy filters] to support different security policies.
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u>
          For example, to reflect changes in the security policy, an
          administrator can change the list of "dirty words" that the security policy mechanism checks
          in accordance with the definitions provided by the organization.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>The information system, when transferring information between different security domains,
          identifies information flows by data type specification and usage.
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u>
          Data type specification and usage include, for example,
          using file naming to reflect type of data and limiting data transfer based on file type.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>The information system, when transferring information between different security domains,
          decomposes information into policy-relevant subcomponents for submission to policy
          enforcement mechanisms.
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u>
          Policy enforcement mechanisms include the filtering
          and/or sanitization rules that are applied to information prior to transfer to a different security
          domain. Parsing transfer files facilitates policy decisions on source, destination, certificates,
          classification, subject, attachments, and other information security-related component
          differentiators. Policy rules for cross domain transfers include, for example, limitations on
          embedding components/information types within other components/information types,
          prohibiting more than two-levels of embedding, and prohibiting the transfer of archived
          information types.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>The information system, when transferring information between different security domains,
          implements policy filters that constrain data structure and content to [Assignment: organization-
          defined information security policy requirements].
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u>
          Constraining file lengths, allowed enumerations, character
          sets, schemas, and other data object attributes reduces the range of potential malicious and/or
          unsanctioned content. Examples of constraints include ensuring that: (i) character data fields
          only contain printable ASCII; (ii) character data fields only contain alpha-numeric characters;
          (iii) character data fields do not contain special characters; or (iv) maximum field sizes and
          file lengths are enforced based upon organization-defined security policy.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>The information system, when transferring information between different security domains, detects
          unsanctioned information and prohibits the transfer of such information in accordance with the
          security policy.
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u>
          Actions to support this enhancement include: checking
          all transferred information for malware, implementing dirty word list searches on transferred
          information, and applying the same protection measures to metadata (e.g., security attributes)
          that is applied to the information payload.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>The information system enforces security policies regarding information on interconnected systems.
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u>
          Transferring information between interconnected
          information systems of differing security policies introduces risk that such transfers violate
          one or more policies. While security policy violations may not be absolutely prohibited,
          policy guidance from information owners/stewards is implemented at the policy enforcement
          point between the interconnected systems. Specific architectural solutions are mandated,
          when required, to reduce the potential for undiscovered vulnerabilities. Architectural
          solutions include, for example: (i) prohibiting information transfers between interconnected
          systems (i.e. implementing access only, one way transfer mechanisms); (ii) employing
          hardware mechanisms to enforce unitary information flow directions; and (iii) implementing
          fully tested, re-grading mechanisms to reassign security attributes and associated security
          labels.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>The information system:
        <ol class="loweralpha">
          <li>Uniquely identifies and authenticates source and destination domains for information transfer;</li>
          <li>Binds security attributes to information to facilitate information flow policy enforcement; and</li>
          <li>Tracks problems associated with the security attribute binding and information transfer.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u>
          Attribution is a critical component of a security concept
          of operations. The ability to identify source and destination points for information flowing in
          an information system, allows forensic reconstruction of events when required, and increases
          policy compliance by attributing policy violations to specific organizations/individuals.
          Means to enforce this enhancement include ensuring that the information system resolution
          labels distinguish between information systems and organizations, and between specific
          system components or individuals involved in preparing, sending, receiving, or disseminating
          information.
