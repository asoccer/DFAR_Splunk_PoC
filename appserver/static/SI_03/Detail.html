    <h1>SI-3 MALICIOUS CODE PROTECTION</h1><br/>

    <h2>Control</h2>
    <p>
      The organization:
      <ol class="loweralpha">
        <li>Employs malicious code protection mechanisms at information system entry and exit points
            and at workstations, servers, or mobile computing devices on the network to detect and
            eradicate malicious code:
          <ul>
            <li>Transported by electronic mail, electronic mail attachments, web accesses, removable
                media, or other common means; or</li>
            <li>Inserted through the exploitation of information system vulnerabilities;</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Updates malicious code protection mechanisms (including signature definitions) whenever
            new releases are available in accordance with organizational configuration management
            policy and procedures;</li>
        <li>Configures malicious code protection mechanisms to:
          <ul>
            <li>Perform periodic scans of the information system [Assignment: organization-defined
                frequency] and real-time scans of files from external sources as the files are downloaded,
                opened, or executed in accordance with organizational security policy; and</li>
            <li>[Selection (one or more): block malicious code; quarantine malicious code; send alert to
                administrator; [Assignment: organization-defined action]] in response to malicious code
                detection; and</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Addresses the receipt of false positives during malicious code detection and eradication and
            the resulting potential impact on the availability of the information system.</li>
      </ol>

    <h2>Supplemental Guidance</h2>
    <p>
      Information system entry and exit points include, for example, firewalls,
      electronic mail servers, web servers, proxy servers, and remote-access servers. Malicious code
      includes, for example, viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and spyware. Malicious code can also be
      encoded in various formats (e.g., UUENCODE, Unicode) or contained within a compressed file.
      Removable media includes, for example, USB devices, diskettes, or compact disks. A variety of
      technologies and methods exist to limit or eliminate the effects of malicious code attacks.
      Pervasive configuration management and strong software integrity controls may be effective in
      preventing execution of unauthorized code. In addition to commercial off-the-shelf software,
      malicious code may also be present in custom-built software. This could include, for example,
      logic bombs, back doors, and other types of cyber attacks that could affect organizational missions
      and business functions. Traditional malicious code protection mechanisms are not built to detect
      such code. In these situations, organizations must rely instead on other risk mitigation measures to
      include, for example, secure coding practices, trusted procurement processes, configuration
      management and control, and monitoring practices to help ensure that software does not perform
      functions other than those intended. Related controls: SA-4, SA-8, SA-12, SA-13, SI-4, SI-7.

    <h2>Control Enhancements</h2>
    <ol class="decimal">
      <li>The organization centrally manages malicious code protection mechanisms.</li>
      <li>The information system automatically updates malicious code protection mechanisms (including
          signature definitions).</li>
      <li>The information system prevents non-privileged users from circumventing malicious code
          protection capabilities.</li>
      <li>The information system updates malicious code protection mechanisms only when directed by a
          privileged user.</li>
      <li>The organization does not allow users to introduce removable media into the information system.</li>
      <li>The organization tests malicious code protection mechanisms [Assignment: organization-defined
          frequency] by introducing a known benign, non-spreading test case into the information system
          and subsequently verifying that both detection of the test case and associated incident reporting
          occur, as required.</li>
