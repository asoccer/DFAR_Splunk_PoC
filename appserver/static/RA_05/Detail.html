      The organization:<br/>
      <ol class="loweralpha">
        <li>Scans for vulnerabilities in the information system and hosted applications [Assignment:
            organization-defined frequency and/or randomly in accordance with organization-defined
            process] and when new vulnerabilities potentially affecting the system/applications are
            identified and reported;</li>
        <li>Employs vulnerability scanning tools and techniques that promote interoperability among
            tools and automate parts of the vulnerability management process by using standards for:
          <ul>
            <li>Enumerating platforms, software flaws, and improper configurations;</li>
            <li>Formatting and making transparent, checklists and test procedures; and</li>
            <li>Measuring vulnerability impact;</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Analyzes vulnerability scan reports and results from security control assessments;</li>
        <li>Remediates legitimate vulnerabilities [Assignment: organization-defined response times] in
            accordance with an organizational assessment of risk; and</li>
        <li>Shares information obtained from the vulnerability scanning process and security control
            assessments with designated personnel throughout the organization to help eliminate similar
            vulnerabilities in other information systems (i.e., systemic weaknesses or deficiencies).</li>

    <h2>Supplemental Guidance</h2>
    <p>
      The security categorization of the information system guides the frequency
      and comprehensiveness of the vulnerability scans. Vulnerability analysis for custom software and
      applications may require additional, more specialized techniques and approaches (e.g., web-based
      application scanners, source code reviews, source code analyzers). Vulnerability scanning
      includes scanning for specific functions, ports, protocols, and services that should not be
      accessible to users or devices and for improperly configured or incorrectly operating information
      flow mechanisms. The organization considers using tools that express vulnerabilities in the
      Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming convention and that use the Open
      Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL) to test for the presence of vulnerabilities. The
      Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) and the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) are also
      excellent sources for vulnerability information. In addition, security control assessments such as
      red team exercises are another source of potential vulnerabilities for which to scan. Related
      controls: CA-2, CM-6, RA-3, SI-2.

    <h2>Control Enhancements</h2>
    <ol class="decimal">
      <li>The organization employs vulnerability scanning tools that include the capability to readily update
          the list of information system vulnerabilities scanned.</li>
      <li>The organization updates the list of information system vulnerabilities scanned [Assignment:
          organization-defined frequency] or when new vulnerabilities are identified and reported.</li>
      <li>The organization employs vulnerability scanning procedures that can demonstrate the breadth and
          depth of coverage (i.e., information system components scanned and vulnerabilities checked).</li>
      <li>The organization attempts to discern what information about the information system is
          discoverable by adversaries.</li>
      <li>The organization includes privileged access authorization to [Assignment: organization-identified
          information system components] for selected vulnerability scanning activities to facilitate more
          thorough scanning.</li>
      <li>The organization employs automated mechanisms to compare the results of vulnerability scans
          over time to determine trends in information system vulnerabilities.</li>
      <li>The organization employs automated mechanisms [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]
          to detect the presence of unauthorized software on organizational information systems and notify
          designated organizational officials.</li>
      <li>The organization reviews historic audit logs to determine if a vulnerability identified in the
          information system has been previously exploited.</li>
      <li>The organization employs an independent penetration agent or penetration team to:
        <ol class="loweralpha">
          <li>Conduct a vulnerability analysis on the information system; and</li>
          <li>Perform penetration testing on the information system based on the vulnerability analysis to
              determine the exploitability of identified vulnerabilities.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u>
          A standard method for penetration testing includes: (i)
          pre-test analysis based on full knowledge of the target information system; (ii) pre-test
          identification of potential vulnerabilities based on pre-test analysis; and (iii) testing designed
          to determine exploitability of identified vulnerabilities. Detailed rules of engagement are
          agreed upon by all parties before the commencement of any penetration testing scenario.
