    <h1>CA-7 CONTINUOUS MONITORING</h1><br/>

    <h2>Control</h2>
    <p>The organization establishes a continuous monitoring strategy and implements a
       continuous monitoring program that includes:
      <ol class="loweralpha">
        <li>A configuration management process for the information system and its constituent components;</li>
        <li>A determination of the security impact of changes to the information system and environment of operation;</li>
        <li>Ongoing security control assessments in accordance with the organizational continuous monitoring strategy; and</li>
        <li>Reporting the security state of the information system to appropriate organizational officials
            [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <h2>Supplemental Guidance</h2>
    <p>
      A continuous monitoring program allows an organization to maintain the
      security authorization of an information system over time in a highly dynamic environment of
      operation with changing threats, vulnerabilities, technologies, and missions/business processes.
      Continuous monitoring of security controls using automated support tools facilitates near real-time
      risk management and promotes organizational situational awareness with regard to the security
      state of the information system. The implementation of a continuous monitoring program results
      in ongoing updates to the security plan, the security assessment report, and the plan of action and
      milestones, the three principal documents in the security authorization package. A rigorous and
      well executed continuous monitoring program significantly reduces the level of effort required for
      the reauthorization of the information system. Continuous monitoring activities are scaled in
      accordance with the impact level of the information system. Related controls: CA-2, CA-5, CA-6,
      CM-3, CM-4.

    <h2>Control Enhancements</h2>
    <ol class="decimal">
      <li>The organization employs an independent assessor or assessment team to monitor the security
          controls in the information system on an ongoing basis.
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u> The organization can extend and maximize the value of
          the ongoing assessment of security controls during the continuous monitoring process by
          requiring an independent assessor or team to assess all of the security controls during the
          information systemâ€™s three-year authorization cycle. See supplemental guidance for CA-2,
          enhancement (1), for further information on assessor independence. Related controls: CA-2,
          CA-5, CA-6, CM-4.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>The organization plans, schedules, and conducts assessments [Assignment: organization-defined
          frequency], [Selection: announced; unannounced], [Selection: in-depth monitoring; malicious user
          testing; penetration testing; red team exercises; [Assignment: organization-defined other forms of
          security assessment]] to ensure compliance with all vulnerability mitigation procedures.
        <p>
          <u>Enhancement Supplemental Guidance:</u> Examples of vulnerability mitigation procedures are
          contained in Information Assurance Vulnerability Alerts. Testing is intended to ensure that
          the information system continues to provide adequate security against constantly evolving
          threats and vulnerabilities. Conformance testing also provides independent validation. See
          supplemental guidance for CA-2, enhancement (2) for further information on malicious user
          testing, penetration testing, red-team exercises, and other forms of security testing. Related
          control: CA-2.
